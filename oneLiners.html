<p>A recent study has found that a women who carry a little extra weight live
longer than men who mention it.</p>
<p>If I had a dollar for every girl that found me unattractive, they would
eventually find me attractive.</p>
<p>Today a man knocked on my door and asked for a small donation to the local
swimming pool, I gave him a glass of water.</p>
<p>Life is all about perspective: The sinkning of the Titanic was a miracle to
lobsters in the ship's kitchen.</p>
<p>My wife and I were happy for 20 years, then we met.</p>
<p>You know that tingly feeling you get whe you like someone, that's your common
sense leaving your body.</p>
<p>Relationships are a lot like algebra: Have you ever looked at you X and
wondered Y?</p>
<p>I want to die peacefully in my sleep like my grandfather, not screaming and
yelling like the passengers in his car.</p>
<p>I find it ironic that the colors red, white, and blue stand for freedom until
they are flashing behind you.</p>
<p>When wearing a bikini, women reveal 90% of their body...men are so polite
they only look at the covered part.</p>
<p>You know your ugly when it comes to a group picture and they hand you the
camera.</p>
<p>Life is like toilet paper, you're either on a rool or taking shit from an
asshole.</p>
<p>Isn't it great to live in the 21st century where deleting history has become
more important than making it.</p>
<p>Just read that 4,153,237 people got married lastnyear, not to cause any
trouble but shouldn't that number be even?</p>
<p>When my boss asked me who is the stupid one, me or him, so I told him
everyone knows he doesn't hire stupid people</p>
<p>You're not fat, you're just...easier to see.</p>
<p>Strong people don't put others down, they lift them up and slam them on  the
ground for maximum damage.</p>
<p>How do I disable the autocorrect function on my wife?</p>
<p>I can totally keep secrets, it's the people I tell them to that can't.</p>
<p>Before I criticize a man I like to walk a mile in his shoes, thay way when I
do criticize him, I'm a mile away and have his shoes.</p>
<p>Teamwork is important; it helps to put the blame on someone else.</p>
<p>Apparently I snore so loud loudly that it scares everyone in the car I'm
driving.</p>
<p>I'm great at multitasking: I can waste time, be unproductive, and
procrastinate all at once.</p>
<p>That awkward moment when you leave a store without buying anything and all
you can think is "act natural, you're innocent."</p>
<p>I used to think I was indecive, but now I am not so sure.</p>
<p>My therapist says I have a preoccupation with vengeance; we'll see about that</p>
<p>Take my advice - I'm not using it.</p>
<p>I think my neighbor is stalking as she's been googling my name on her computer;
I saw it through my telescope.</p>
<p>Money talks... but all mine ever says is goodbye.</p>
<p>Politicians and diapers have one thing in common; they should both be changed
regularly and for the same reason.</p>
<p>I'm not saying I hate you, but I would unplug your life support to charge my
phone.</p>
<p>When Miley Cyrus get naked and licks a hammer it's called "art" and "music",
but when I do it, I'm "drunk" and "I have to leave the hardware store".</p>
<p>Child's experiance: if a mother is laughing at the fathers jokes, it means
they have guests.</p>
<p>Alcohol is a perfect slovent, it dissolve marriages, families, and careers.</p>
<p>Hospitality: making your guests feel at home, even if you wish they were</p>
<p>Woman spend more time wondering what men are thinking than men spend thinking.</p>
<p>If you can smile when things go wrong, you have someone in mind to blame.</p>
<p>Intelligence is like underwear: it is important that you have have it, but
not that you show it off</p>
<p>I changed my password to "incorrect" so whenever I forget my password, my
computor will say, "Your password is incorrect"</p>
<p>I asked God for a bike but I know God doesn't work that way, so I stole a
stole a bike and asked for forgiveness.</p>
<p>Any married man should forget his mistakes, there is no use in two people 
remembering the same thing.</p>
<p>Good health is merely the slowest possible rate at which one can die.</p>
